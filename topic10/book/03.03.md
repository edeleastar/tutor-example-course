#Reading from the Database

In this step we would like to have the 'members' page display the actual members in the database. Currently this is a hard coded list of Simpsons:

~~~html
...

<section class="ui segment">
  <h2 class="ui header">SpaceBook's Members</h2>
  <div class="ui list">
    <div class="item">
      <i class="right triangle icon"></i> marge [<a href="home.html">follow</a>]
    </div>
    <div class="item">
      <i class="right triangle icon"></i> bart [<a href="home.html">follow</a>]
    </div>
    <div class="item">
      <i class="right triangle icon"></i> lisa [<a href="home.html">follow</a>]
    </div>
    <div class="item">
      <i class="right triangle icon"></i> maggie [<a href="home.html">follow</a>]
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
~~~

which is generated by 'app/controllers/Members.java' class:

~~~java
public class Members extends Controller
{
  public static void index()
  {
    render();
  }
}
~~~

To display a list of the members, we will retrieve it from the Users database. Change the index() function above as follows:

~~~java
  public static void index()
  {
    List<User> users = User.findAll();
    render(users);
  }
~~~

In the view, replace the complete section with the following:

~~~html
<section class="ui segment">
  <h2 class="ui header">SpaceBook's Members</h2>
  <div class="ui list">
    #{list items:users, as:'user'}
      <div class="item">
        <i class="right triangle icon"></i> 
        <div class="content">
          ${user.firstName} ${user.lastName} <a href="/members/follow/${user.id}"> (follow) </a>
        </div>
      </div> 
    #{/list}
  </div>
</section>
~~~

This is unusual syntax - it is not html, but rather what is called a templating language. In this case it is a way of writing a loop in a html-like notation, to read a list of users and display them inside a html list element. There are literally dozens of templating languages - this is a fairly simple one that comes with our play framework.

Save everything and visit the members page. You should see a list of users full names. Sign up a few new members, and verify that they appear in the members page.
