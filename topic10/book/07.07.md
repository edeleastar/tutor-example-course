#Dropping Friends

You may have parts of this already implemented in an exercise in an earlier lab. If not, them introduce (or change) these features now:

In the Home controller we need an action to be called if a friend is to be dropped:

~~~java
  public static void drop(Long id)
  {
    Logger.info("Dropping " + id);
    index();
  }
~~~

..and this is the corresponding entry in the 'conf/routes file:

~~~
GET     /home/drop/{id}                       Home.drop
~~~

Here is what we would like to do now:

- once we get the id, delete the user from the 'following' list
- refresh the display, which will see the user removed from the list. 

Here is new link to be displayed after each friends' name in  `views/Home/index.html`:

~~~html
 (<a href="/home/drop/${friendship.targetUser.id}"> drop </a>)
~~~

Here is a drop implementation that deletes the friendship:

~~~java
  public static void drop(Long id)
  {
    String userId = session.get("logged_in_userid");
    User user = User.findById(Long.parseLong(userId));
    
    User friend = User.findById(id);
 
    user.unfriend(friend);
    Logger.info("Dropping " + friend.email);
    index();
  }  
~~~

The pattern in the above should start to become familiar. First we find out who is logged in:

~~~java
    String userId = session.get("logged_in_userid");
    User user = User.findById(Long.parseLong(userId));
~~~

Then we find out which user is about to be dropped:

~~~java
    User friend = User.findById(id);
~~~

We then remove the user from the logged in users following list (and we save the user as we have changed something):

~~~java
    user.unfriend(friend);
~~~

Finally, we log what has just happened, and refresh the view:

~~~java
    Logger.info("Dropping " + friend.email);
    index();
~~~

Save everything in Eclipse and try this out now. Whenever you make significant changes, it is often best to restart the app.

You should be able to add and remove users from the 'following' list.
