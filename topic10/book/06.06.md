#Displaying the Friends list

Our home page currently has a list of members we are following 'hard-coded' in 'views/home/index.html':

~~~html
      <div class="ui column">
        <h2>Friends</h2>
        <div class="ui list">
          <div class="item">
            <i class="right triangle icon"></i> <a href="/publicprofile/marge">marge</a>, (<a href="drop/marge">drop</a>)
          </div>
          <div class="item">
            <i class="right triangle icon"></i> <a href="/publicprofile/lisa">lisa</a>, (<a href="drop/lisa">drop</a>)
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

~~~

We have already done something like what we want to do in step 04: i.e. display a list of names, retrieved from the database. 

Replace this section with the following:

~~~html
        <h2>Friends</h2>
        <div class="ui list">
          #{list items:user.friendships, as:'friendship'}
            <div class="item">
              <i class="right triangle icon"></i>
              <div class="content">
                ${friendship.targetUser.firstName} ${friendship.targetUser.lastName}
              </div>
            </div>
          #{/list}
        </div>
 ~~~

(try to keep the indentation consistent).

Save everything in Eclipse, and refresh your home page. The 'Following' list is now dynamically generated. 

Note the connection between this method in the Home class:

~~~Java
  public static void index()
  {
    String userId = session.get("logged_in_userid");
    User user = User.findById(Long.parseLong(userId));
    render(user);
  }
~~~

... and this template code:

~~~html
          #{list items:user.friendships, as:'friendship'}
            <div class="item">
              <i class="right triangle icon"></i>
              <div class="content">
                ${friendship.targetUser.firstName} ${friendship.targetUser.lastName}
              </div>
            </div>
          #{/list}
~~~

In particular, as the User class now has a member called 'friendships' - we are just passing the currently logged in 'user' to the render method, which passes this on to the view. In the view, we just iterate through the friendship member of the user object we receive. This looks confusing at first, but it is reasonably straightforward and predictable once you get used to it.

Experiment with signing up more members, logging in, and watching the list of friends growing.

Also, keep an eye on the database. See if you can make sense of the contents of the friendships table.
