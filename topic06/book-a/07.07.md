#Forms

Designing forms is more complicated that the elements of Semantic UI we have looked at so far.

We will return to it in a few weeks. In the meantime, we can take change the `second` column of home profile - currently looking like this:

~~~
      <article class="ui column"">
        <form action="homeprofile/changetext" method="post">         
          <textarea name="profiletext" cols="30" rows="8" ></textarea>  
          <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Change"  /> 
        </form>
      </article>
~~~

and replace it with this version:

~~~
      <article class="ui form column">
        <form action="homeprofile/changetext" method="post">
          <div class="field">
            <label>Status</label> 
            <textarea name="profiletext"> </textarea>
          </div>
          <div class="field">
            <input class="ui blue button" type="submit" name="submit" value="Change" />
          </div>  
        </form>
      </article>
~~~

There will be some subtle changes to the layout, but we will need to explore these in more depth later. Have a read of some of the documentation in the meantime. 

Notice the structure of though. In general a form consistes of fields. and fields may have labels. Also, note the style of the button after we made the above change.
