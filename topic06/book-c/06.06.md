#Routes

In order for the app to function correctly - we need one more change. Locate and open the file 'conf/routes':

~~~
# Routes
# This file defines all application routes (Higher priority routes first)
#

# Home page
GET     /                                       Application.index

# Ignore favicon requests
GET     /favicon.ico                            404

# Map static resources from the /app/public folder to the /public path
GET     /public/                                staticDir:public

# Catch all
*       /{controller}/{action}                  {controller}.{action}
~~~

Edit the file to look like this:

~~~
# Routes
# This file defines all application routes (Higher priority routes first)
# ~~~~

# Landing page
GET     /                                       Home.index

# Home page
GET     /home                                   Home.index

# Members page
GET     /members                                Members.index

# Profile page
GET     /profile                                Profile.index


# Ignore favicon requests
GET     /favicon.ico                            404

# Map static resources from the /app/public folder to the /public path
GET     /public/                                staticDir:public

# Catch all
*       /{controller}/{action}                  {controller}.{action}

Each of your view files contains a :

~~~
..
<p>
  Welcome to Spacebook!
</p>
~~~

Change the message for each page - so that a different welcome message appears:

- 'Welcome to the Spacebook Home Page'
- 'Welcome to the Spacebook Members Page'
- 'Welcome to the Spacebook Profile Page'

Do this by editing each of the index.html pages as appropriate

Now, restart the app. To restart it bring up the command prompt that launched the application, and type Ctrl-C. Then type 'play run' again.

Browse to:

- <http://localhost:9000>

to see the updated app in action. The navigation bar should now function without errors (except for logout item).

Finally, note that each index.html page contains the following near the top:

~~~
#{set title:'Home' /}
~~~

Change this such that each page has its own title:

- Home
- Members
- Profile

Note that this text will appear in the browsers window title - not on the canvas. Run the app and verify that this behaves as expected.
