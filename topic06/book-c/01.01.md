In DOS, from inside the spacebook folder, type the following command:

~~~
play run

Play will respond with something like this:

Also notice that a log message will appear in the command window indicating that the app has started:

~~~

~~~

To stop the application, press "Control+C" in the command prompt.  If you refresh the browser window, then you should now get an error

Start the app again by typing 'play run' as above. Verify that the app has started by browsing/refreshing to:

- <http://localhost:9000/>

Try this a few times to get used to starting/stopping the application
