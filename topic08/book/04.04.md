#Responding to forms

When you press signup or login either of these pages:

- <http://localhost:9000/signup>
- <http://localhost:9000/login>

we get a 'Not Found' error. What should happen should be something like:

- Register: storing the new details somewhere, so when the user logs in subsequently
we can see if they are valid users
- Authenticate: check to see if this is a valid user, and let them in to the rest of the app if
the are.

A natural place for us to do this processing is to implement suitable methods in the 'Accounts' class:

~~~java
  public static void register()
  {
  }

  public static void authenticate()
  {
  }
~~~

Introduce these functions into Accounts now. What should we do in them? For the moment we do the following:

- Register: Redirect to the start page (where the user can proceed to log in)
- Authenticate: Just redirect to the home controller

These are accomplished by the following:

~~~java
  public static void register()
  {
    index();
  }

  public static void authenticate()
  {
    Home.index();
  }
~~~

However, if you try these links now (login or signup), we still get the not found error.

Introduce these additional into the routes file:

~~~
POST   /authenticate                            Accounts.authenticate
POST   /register                                Accounts.register
~~~

Note the difference here - the two new routes are 'POST' (not 'GET') routes.

Test the app now, and verify that you are able to navigate as expected. You should be able to visit each page, from the start. Note that any value you enter will be ignored - you will always be able to log in. However, we have the basic nav structure in place which we can build on later.
