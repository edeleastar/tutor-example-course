#Local Repository

You recall that we may be using a 'bootstrap.java' class to load the models. This may cause some difficulty with our deployment, so we will remove it from the project for the moment. You can do this from within Eclipse by commenting out the database initialization code:

~~~
import java.util.List;

import play.*;
import play.jobs.*;
import play.test.*;
 
import models.*;
 
@OnApplicationStart
public class Bootstrap extends Job 
{ 
  public void doJob()
  {
    if (User.count() == 0)
    {
      // Fixtures.deleteDatabase();
      // Fixtures.loadModels("data.yml");
    }
  }
}
~~~

Now, in the spacebook project, create a file called '.gitignore'. This is a special file containing a series of patterns for project files we do NOT want uploaded to heroku.

Here are its contents:

~~~
# Ignore all dotfiles...
.*
# except for .gitignore
!.gitignore
!.classpath
!.project


# Ignore Play! working directory #
war
db
eclipse
lib
log
logs
modules
precompiled
project/project
project/target
crud/*
data/*
conf/crud/*
conf/cloudbees*
public/crud/*
target
tmp
test-result
server.pid
*.iml
*.eml
~~~

Still in the same project folder, create and a file named **ProcFile** containing the following:

~~~
web: play run --http.port=$PORT $PLAY_OPTS
~~~

Next, we need to make one significant change to the app. Open the 'Users' model and adjust the the class as follows:

~~~
@Entity
@Table(name="`User`") //This is necessary because User is a reserved word in PostGreSQL
public class User extends Model
~~~

'User' is a reserved table name in the database, so we have altered the name slightly to avoid a conflict.

In Git Bash terminal *cd* into the folder containing your spacebook project, and create a git repository for the project:

~~~
git init
~~~

Add all files (except those matched by .gitignore) to the repo and commit them using these commands:

```
git add --all
git commit -m "first commit"
```

Verify that everything is ok by running this command

```
git status
```

The response should as follow:

We have now established a local git repository containing only those files required to run the application. Our next step is to push this repository to the heroku service.
