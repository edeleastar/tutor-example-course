#Exercises

##Exercise 1: Experiment with Deploy

Deploy the app once and use it. Make a superficial but noticeable change to the UI, and deploy it again. Make sure the changes you made are present in the deployed app.

##Exercise 2 Experiment with Logs

After deploying the app, open a new shell in the same folder as the app, and enter the following command:

~~~
heroku logs --tail
~~~

This will display the `logs` from the app, including any log statements you may have left in the application. See if you can these messages appear as you use the app.

Further log documentation here:

Explore this documentation, and see if there are other useful options.

##Exercise 3: Heroku UI

Log into heroku and explore the various panels and dashboards. See if you can identify the database your app is using. See if you can delete your deployed app using the web ui.

##Exercise 4: More deployments

Can you deploy two versions of your app to Heroku - both running concurrently?
