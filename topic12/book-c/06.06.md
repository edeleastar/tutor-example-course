#Further Modifications

Every time you wish to run the application locally for test purposes, you will need to comment out the new database entry:

~~~
#================heroku databse config config=========================
#db=${DATABASE_URL}
#jpa.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
#jpa.ddl=update
#================end database config heroku config====================
~~~

... and bring back in the in memory database:

~~~
db.default=mem
~~~

You may also wish to bring back in the bootstrap load of the models:

~~~
import java.util.List;

import play.*;
import play.jobs.*;
import play.test.*;
 
import models.*;
 
@OnApplicationStart
public class Bootstrap extends Job 
{ 
  public void doJob()
  {
    if (User.count() == 0)
    {
      Fixtures.deleteDatabase();
      Fixtures.loadModels("data.yml");
    }
  }
}
~~~

The above modifications will have to be reversed if you wish to deploy the app again.

##Deploy Commands:

In order to successfully deploy, the app must be 'commited' to github, and then pushed. These are the commands for a regular deploy (assuming the app has been deployed successfully at least once already):

~~~
git add --all
git commit -m "SOME DESCRIPTIVE COMMENT"
git push heroku master
~~~

The comment above would be a short statement about the changes you have introduced. You will learn more about git commits in future labs.
