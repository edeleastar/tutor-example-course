#Heroku Database

You created a Heroku app in an earlier step (using the command *heroku create*) 

- A database was made available as part of the app creation process.
- You can verify this by running the following command:

```
heroku pg:info
```

A typical response is depicted in Figure 1.

![Figure 1: Database information](img/heroku_012.png)

In this case the DATABASE_URL is HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_MAUVE_URL.

Log in to [Heroku](https://dashboard-next.heroku.com/apps/) website for more detailed information such as is shown here in Figure 2 for the current project.

![Figure 2: App and associated database details on Heroku site](img/heroku_025.png)

In order to make use of this database do the following:

- Modify the *application.conf* file by commenting  out any database activation statements such as, for example

~~~
# db.default=mem
~~~

Add the following block to the end of the file.

```
#================heroku databse config config=========================
db=${DATABASE_URL}
jpa.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
jpa.ddl=update
#================end database config heroku config====================
```

- In the Heroku terminal add and commit the changes:

```
git add --all
git commit -m "database configured"
git push heroku master
```
The response should be similar to that shown in Figure 3.

**Test App**

You can test that the application is working correctly in a number of ways, listed here:

- Run the following command: output similar to that in Figure 4 indicates your app has been successfully deployed.

```
heroku ps
```

Next run the command to open a browser: Figure 5 shows the command and additionally the response to the command and the output in the browser if the app is running correctly.

```
heroku open
```

This should open your web browser and display the application directly on the heroku platform.
