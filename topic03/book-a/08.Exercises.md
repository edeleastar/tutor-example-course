#Exercise

This is the final version of the project:

- [lab03](archives/lab03.zip)

#Exercise 1:

Look again at these CSS rules:

~~~
#weeklyspecials {
  border-width: thin;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: #007e7e;

  width: 25%;
  padding: 0px 20px 30px 10px
  margin-left: 20px;

  text-align: center;

  float:right;
}

#maincontent {
  float:left;
  width:70%;
}
~~~

Experiment with the various dimensions you can see here. Specifically, the 'width' and 'padding' dimensions. Remember you have to save the changes and refresh the page to see the effect.

#Exercise 2:

Continue to experiment with the parameters, this time exploring alternatives to the 'border-style', 'border-width' and 'border-color' properties. See if you can make sense of some of the documentation here:
