Any change you make in the sublime will only appear in the browser if you:

- save the changes in sublime
- refresh the page in chrome.

Make sure both pages render in chrome as expected.

Additionally, chrome has some interesting features to let you explore the page 'source'. The simplest one is to just right click anywhere in the browsers and select `View Source`:

A more sophisticated option is to use `Developer Tools`:

To reproduce the above, first close the `source` view we just opened above, and proceed to access the tools as shown here:

Explore the developer tools for a little while - notice how the `box model` seems to be visible. Then close it, we will return to it later.
