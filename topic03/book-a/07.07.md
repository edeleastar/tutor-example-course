#Sidebar

Open the main index.html and locate the `Weekly Specials` heading. Place a new `<div>` element immediately before this element:

~~~
    <div id="weeklyspecials">
    <h2>Weekly Specials</h2>
~~~

we must now close the `<div>` a little later in the file, just after this  paragraph: 

~~~
    <p>
      See some other great deals <a href="deals/index.html" title="Deals">here</a>.
    </p>
    </div>
~~~

If you "indent" everything inside the `<div>` - i.e. push all of the enclosed element in by 2 spaces - then the folding editor will allow you to 'fold' the entire division:

I.e. - it is hiding temporarily the enclose elements. This can be difficult to get exactly right - as the folding requires the indentation being precisely correct. Here is the correctly indented section if you are having trouble:

         Stacksocial just published its so called Free Ondesoft Mac Tool Bundle, which contains 
         apps from Ondesoft. The bundle worth $146 will be probably available only a couple of

This allows us to keep an eye on the complete page in a single glance - very useful of the page is long or incorporates a very specific structure you need to manage.

Here is the complete main index.html page if you are struggling with the indentation:
