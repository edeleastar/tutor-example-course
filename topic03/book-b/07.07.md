#Simplify

Our full CSS is now as follows:

~~~css
body
{
  width: 80%;  
  margin: 0 auto;
}

#maincontent
{  
  width: 80%;
  float: right;  
  border: dashed thin;
}

#navigation
{  
  width: 18%;
  float: left;  
  border: dashed thin;
}

#header
{
  width: 100%;
  border: dashed thin;
}

#footer
{  
  width: 100%;
  clear: both;
  border: dashed thin;
}
~~~

Note the repeated border property. We introduced this property so that we could get a clearer view of our sections. Presumable we would like to remove it prior to production. However, this will mean deleting/commenting it out from every rule.

This single property appears in every rule. We can create a new "wildcard" rule as follows:

~~~css
*
{
  border: dashed thin;
}
~~~

Now, we can delete this from all of the other rules:

~~~css
body
{
  width: 80%;  
  margin: 0 auto;
}

#maincontent
{  
  width: 80%;
  float: right;  
}

#navigation
{  
  width: 18%;
  float: left;  
}

#header
{
  width: 100%;
}

#footer
{  
  width: 100%;
  clear: both;
}
~~~

And when we want to remove the border, we can just delete that rule.
