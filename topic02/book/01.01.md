##Files for Lab02

For some of the labs, we would like to build on a foundation established from the previous weeks work. However, we might find it useful to keep the project separate, so the earlier labs are preserved as we left them (in case we wish to revert to them). Normally this would be the task of a revision control system such as git or subversion. For the moment we will just duplicate the projects


You should have the files created from last week. If you do then make a copy of the Lab1 folder and name the new copy Lab2.

However, if you did not save the files or missed the class, here is the archive here of the completed lab (with exercises):

- [lab01-incl-exercises.zip](./archives/lab01-incl-exercises.zip)

When you expand the zip file rename the top folder (lab01-incl-exercises) as Lab02. Save this Lab02 folder into your WebDevelopment folder that you created last week.


Open Sublime and navigate to Lab02:

Create a new folder called Deals, in that folder create a new page name it deals.html.
Put the following code into the page and save.

~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1" />
    <title>App Bundle Deals</title>
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Business Bundle</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="images/business.png" alt="Business Bundle" />
        Here comes the next bundle for march. This time it's macware who publish a bundle. The so called macware Business Bundle contains 6 apps at a price of only $29.99 instead of $199.94. So you can save around 84%.
    </p>
    <a href="index.html">Home</a>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

This images needed for this page:

![](./img/business.png)
![](./img/insanity.jpg)

View the page in the web browser. What is wrong with it?
We wrote all of the href path's the same as we had before so why do they not work for the link and the images?
If we are viewing the deals web page stored in the deals folder, does that folder contain the index.html file? No is the simple answer so our path is incorrect. We must tell the browser to move up a level in the directories in order to find those pages. Your paths's should be as below for each link and for each image. It is very important at this stage to understand this example as you need to be able to write correct paths to your files and images.

    <h2>Business Bundle</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="../images/business.png" alt="Business Bundle" />
        Here comes the next bundle for march. This time it's macware who publish a bundle. The so called macware Business Bundle contains 6 apps at a price of only $29.99 instead of $199.94. So you can save around 84%.
    </p>
     <h2>Insanity Deal</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="../images/insanity.jpg" alt="Insanity Deal" />
        With the new $5 Insanity Deals from Bundlehunt you receive every day a highly reduced app for $5 only with savings up to 75%. Not a real bundle but, as there are multiple apps for only $5 each, one new per day, for the days to come.
    </p>
    <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
  </body>
</html>

On the index.html page add a link to the deals.html page. Test the link to make sure you have written the path correctly.
