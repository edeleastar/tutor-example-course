#Profile Page Heading

We can do a similar exercise for the home profile page. This is how it is 'rendered':

~~~java
public class Profile extends Controller
{
  public static void index()
  {
    render();
  }
}
~~~

We can incorporate the same code we used in the home class to get the currently logged in user name to the view:

~~~java
  public static void index()
  {
    String userId = session.get("logged_in_userid");
    User user = User.findById(Long.parseLong(userId));
    String name = user.firstName;
    render(name);
  }
~~~

...and also change 'views/Profile/index.html' from this:

~~~html
  <h2 class="ui header">Homer's Profile</h2>
~~~

to

~~~html
  <h2 class="ui header">${name}'s Profile</h2>
~~~

Save and reload the home profile page. The users name should appear.

Log out now and login as a different user (you may need to register a new one). Verify that the new user's name appears as expected in the titles of home and home profile views.
