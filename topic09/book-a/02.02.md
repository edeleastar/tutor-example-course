#Sessions

Now we can have users sign up, the next step is to have them log in, and for our app to know who is logged in at any given time.

We will need to decide whether to allow a user to log in (they must register first), and subsequently 'remember' which user has logged in. This is accomplished as follows

- In the login method, see if the given user is registered or not.
- If they are registered, place the user 'id' into a 'session' object
- This session object will be available to other controllers during subsequent page visits.

To do this, rework the login as follows:

~~~java
  public static void authenticate(String email, String password)
  {
    Logger.info("Attempting to authenticate with " + email + ":" +  password);

    User user = User.findByEmail(email);
    if ((user != null) && (user.checkPassword(password) == true))
    {
      Logger.info("Authentication successful");
      session.put("logged_in_userid", user.id);
      Home.index();
    }
    else
    {
      Logger.info("Authentication failed");
      login();  
    }
  }
~~~

Read this code carefully - notice we have two new methods we are calling on the user object:

- findByEmail() - which will look up a table of users and see if there is a match
- checkPassword() - which will check the password against the registered one

These are currently not implement in User. Introduce them now into User model class:

~~~java
  public static User findByEmail(String email)
  {
    return find("email", email).first();
  }

  public boolean checkPassword(String password)
  {
    return this.password.equals(password);
  }
~~~

Try this out now. If an unregistered email/password is entered then the login screen is displayed again. If valid credentials are provided, then we will get the home screen. Also check the console for the appropriate log messages.
