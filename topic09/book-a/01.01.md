#Exercise Solutions

These are solutions to last weeks exercises:

##Exercise 1:

We need to go back to our login form, which currently looks like this (excluding the header for clarity):

~~~html
<section class="ui form segment">
  <form action="/authenticate" method="POST">
    <div class="field">
      <label> Username: </label>
      <input type="text" name="email">
    </div>  
    <div class="field">
      <label>  Password: </label>
      <input type="password" name="password">
    </div>
    <button class="ui blue submit button">Login</button>
  </form>
</section>
~~~

Using step 5 as a guide, introduce the necessary changes to have the email/password transferred from this form to the controller, and logged to the console.

##Exercise 1:Solution

Change the authenticate method in Accounts class as follows:

~~~java
  public static void authenticate(String email, String password)
  {
    Logger.info("Attempting to authenticate with " + email + ":" + password);
    Home.index();
  }
~~~

Run the application, and veify that the logs display the message above.

##Exercise 2:

What happens when you enter text and press 'Change' on the profile page? (Not found presumably). This is the html for that part of the page:

~~~html
        <form action="homeprofile/changetext" method="post">
          <h3 class="ui inverted teal block header">Enter Status</h3>
          <textarea class="ui field" name="profiletext"> </textarea>
          <input class="ui blue button" type="submit" name="submit" value="Change" />
        </form>
~~~

Again using step 5 of this lab as a guide, can you make the necessary changes such that when the Change button is pressed, a log message is printed on the console?

Remember, to implement complete this exercises you will need to write both a java method and a matching route - as demonstrated in step 5. Also. the 'action' attribute of the form above will need to be completed. Also, note the name on the `<textarea>` field.

##Exercise 2:Solution

First we correct the 'action' in the view, to use a more consistent pattern '/profile/changestatus"':

~~~html
        <form action="/profile/changestatus" method="post">
          <h3 class="ui inverted teal block header">Enter Status</h3>
          <textarea class="ui field" name="profiletext"> </textarea>
          <input class="ui blue button" type="submit" name="submit" value="Change" />
        </form>
~~~

Then we create a new entry in the routes file to specifically support this route:

~~~
POST    /profile/changestatus                   Profile.changeStatus
~~~

Finally introduce this new method into the Profile controller:

~~~java
  public static void changeStatus(String profiletext)
  {
    Logger.info("Status changed to " + profiletext);
    index();
  }  
~~~

Test this now.
