#Home Page Heading

Once a user is successfully logged in, we would like to display the user name in the title of some of the pages. Currently this is hard coded on some pages to "Homer Simpson" - views/index.html for instance:

~~~html
  <h2 class="ui header">SpaceBook: Homer's Home Page</h2>
~~~

We would like to have the name of the user passed on to the view so we can display it.

In Accounts.authenticate(), we put the currently logged in user id in the 'session':

~~~java
      session.put("logged_in_userid", user.id);
~~~

We can retrieve it now in the home.index method, and use the id to look up the user in the database. Once we have the user object, we retrieve the users name and pass this to the view.  Rewrite the Home.index function as follows:

~~~java
  public static void index()
  {
    String userId = session.get("logged_in_userid");
    User user = User.findById(Long.parseLong(userId));
    String name = user.firstName;
    render(name);
  }
~~~

Read each line carefully - introduce it into your Home class. Now we can replace the hard coded:

~~~html
<h2 class="ui header">SpaceBook: Homer's Home Page</h2>
~~~

with this:

~~~html
  <h2 class="ui header">SpaceBook: ${name}'s Home Page</h2>
~~~

Try this now. Sign up Homer, and verify that his name appears. Then sign up Marge her name should be on the home page instead.
