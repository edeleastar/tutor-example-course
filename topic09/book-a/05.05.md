#Passing Objects to Views

In the Home controller we have action methods like this:

~~~java
  public static void index()
  {
    String userId = session.get("logged_in_userid");
    User user = User.findById(Long.parseLong(userId));
    String name = user.firstName;
    render(name);
  }
~~~

and in the corresponding view/Home/index.html we have something this:

~~~html
  <h2 class="ui header">SpaceBook: ${name}'s Home Page</h2>
~~~

i.e. we are passing individual strings to the views. This can be significantly enhanced by passing entire objects to the view:

~~~java
  public static void index()
  {
    String userId = session.get("logged_in_userid");
    User user = User.findById(Long.parseLong(userId));
    render(user);
  }
~~~

and

~~~html
  <h2 class="ui header">SpaceBook: Home page for ${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}</h2>
~~~

This, of course, means that other properties of the user object are also available if we need them.

You may need to restart the app - and register a new user - after making the above changes.
