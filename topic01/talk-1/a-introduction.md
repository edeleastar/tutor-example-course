The Nature of the Web

The World Wide Web permeates or lives to an extraordinary degree. However, most of us are unaware of the its technical underpinnings. In this session we explore the nature of the Web and in particular the role of HTTP protocol and the HTML standard. We also identify the 'client/server' nature of the web and its implications. In this context we will gain an understanding of the role of the 'browser' in presenting a web page, and begin to understand pages are retrieved and rendered.
