If you have any queries please do ask your tutor.

#Exercise 1:

Explore this reference site here:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTML>

In particular, locate the `<tags`> you have used in this lab in the Element Reference section:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTML/Element

For examples this is the `<p`> element:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTML/Element/p>

The text is very technical - but some of it will start to make sense over the next few weeks.

#Exercise 2:

At the end of this page:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTML/Element/p>

is a See Also section, which suggests two elements:

- `<hr>`
- `<br>`

Look up these in the reference, and try them out on the page you have designed.
