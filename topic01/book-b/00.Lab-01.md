#Objectives

The labs are where you will do the real learning in this module. In Lab0-01 you will become familiar with the editor Sublime. We will then use this editor to create a simple multi-page web site containing a small variety of text, images and links. In this lab we will explore some of the basic features of CSS, including colours, font and interesting techniques for setting styles across entire sections of a page.
