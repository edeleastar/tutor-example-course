#HTML pages

We are going to create a web site that is based on the Google Play site or the Apple app store. It will present mobile apps, music, and movies to the user.

Choose New File from the File menu, next choose Save from the file menu and name it apps.html
Do the same for a file named movies.html and one called music.html

You should now have the following folder and file structure:
