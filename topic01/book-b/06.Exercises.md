##Solution So Far..

This is an archive (zip file) of a solution to the lab so far:

- [lab01.zip](./archives/lab01.zip)

##1. Index.html

Just to get used to the editor, create a few more new games in the 'index.html', perhaps you can locate content from some web source (including images). Try to identify and replicate the way the code is indented in the existing content.

##2. New pages

Incorporate new content into a directions.html page. It can contain any content you think would be useful. Make sure you add the hyperlinks to the home page and to the app page so that you can navigate to them from the index.html page and back to the index.html page. 

##3. Link the CSS file to all pages

Currently you may not have the CSS file 'linked' to all pages. i.e. only index.html is styled with the css rules you have defined. See if you can link the other pages now.

##4. Lists

In this lab you used the element `<ul`>
Investigate the use of `<ol`> , find out the differences between these elements here:

##5. Images

Investigate reducing the size of the images. Try using an image editor to reduce their size to 10% smaller. It is important to have some understanding of using an image editor. The most basic available on all windows pc/laptop's is Paint which has a resize option on the toolbar.

##6. Free Code Camp

Have a look at this site here:

- <http://freecodecamp.com/>

This is a self paced instructional web site covering a superset of the technologies we will explore in this course. You will need to sign in to make use of the materials effectively. There are a range of sign in options - we recommend you first create an account here:

- <https://github.com/>

and then when you sign up with FreeCodeCamp, you select the 'Sign in with Github' option.

Once you are signed in, there will be an initially overwhelming range of options and features. To get started, restrict your attention to 'Map':

- <http://freecodecamp.com/map>

In particular the `HTML5 and CSS` lessons here:

- <http://freecodecamp.com/map#html5-and-css>

Use any spare time you have at the end of our web development labs to pick your way through these particular lessons.
