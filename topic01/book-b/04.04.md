#CSS

We will now introduce a stylesheet into our project. Stylesheets are usually maintained in separate files with the .css extension. Choose New File from the File menu and name it 'style.css'. 

The folder structure now looks like this:

We bind this file into the project by 'linking' it to our home page. This must be incorporated into the `<head`> element of each page. Currently index.html head section looks like this:


~~~html
  <head>
    <title>Bundle APP Store</title>
  </head>
~~~

We can extend it with a new element to link to the stylesheet. The head section of the index.html home page should now look like this:


~~~html
  <head>
    <title>Bundle APP Store</title>
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" media="screen" />
  </head>
~~~

Save your files and open the index.html page in your browser and keep this window open. There is no visible effect on our page yet until we introduce a rule into the stylesheet. 

Type all of the following into the style.css file (note the American spelling of the word color) :


~~~css
h1
{
  color: red;
}
~~~

Save all your files. Refresh the index page in your browser and see the result of writing this one css rule.

Experiment with the following rules, introducing them one at a time and one after each other in the file:


~~~css
body
{
  font-family:sans-serif;
}
~~~

replace the first one you wrote that changed the h1 colour to red with the following:

~~~css
h1, h2
{
  color: gray
}
~~~

Add this as another rule to the file:

~~~css
h1
{
  border-bottom: 1px solid black;
}
~~~

Your css file now looks like this:
