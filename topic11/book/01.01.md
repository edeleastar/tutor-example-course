#Lab10 Exercise Solutions

##Exercise 1

Currently, when you follow a member there is not obvious change on the screen. i.e. you remain on the members page. 

~~~java
  public static void follow(Long id)
  public static void follow(Long id)
  {
    User friend = User.findById(id);
    
    String userId = session.get("logged_in_userid");
    User me = User.findById(Long.parseLong(userId));
    
    me.befriend(friend);

    index();
  }
~~~

Change this such that when you follow a member, the home page is displayed immediately - where the new entry in the 'following' list should appear. Hint: You will have to call the index() method on the Home class (instead of the Members class as currently)

##Exercise 1 Solution:

Change the last line of the follow action to this:

~~~
    Home.index();
~~~

(remove the existing last line)

##Exercise 2

Is there a way we can display the number of friends we have on the home screen - perhaps in brackets after the 'Friends' text.

Recall that we are accessing the followers list in the 'home/index.html' view:

~~~html
       <h2>Friends</h2>
        <div class="ui list">
          #{list items:user.friendships, as:'friendship'}
            <div class="item">
              <i class="right triangle icon"></i>
              <a href="/publicprofile/${friendship.targetUser.id}"> ${friendship.targetUser.firstName} ${friendship.targetUser.lastName}</a>
              (<a href="/home/drop/${friendship.targetUser.id}"> drop </a>)
            </div>
          #{/list}
        </div>
~~~

'user.friends' is the list friends, and 'user.friends.size()' will retrieve the number of entries in this list. In order to use this in a html element, you would need to surround it with `${...}`, as in: '`${user.friends.size()}`

##Exercise 2 Solution


Replace the current header in views/Home/index.html with this:

~~~html
    <h2>Friends (${user.friendships.size()})</h2>
~~~
