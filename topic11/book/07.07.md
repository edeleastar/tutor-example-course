#Pictures

Our final feature is to facilitate the uploading of a profile picture for a user. This is a feature to be available on the public profile view: The first step to introduce a new attribute into the User model class to hold the profile picture:

~~~java
  public Blob   profilePicture;
~~~

Bring this in just after the statusText member. 

You will also need to 'import' this type - so anywhere in the imports section, include this line:

~~~java
import play.db.jpa.Blob;
~~~

Now in the Profile controller, we need two new methods - one to retrieve the profile picture, and one to upload it:

~~~java
  public static void getPicture(Long id) 
  {
    User user = User.findById(id);
    Blob picture = user.profilePicture;
    if (picture.exists())
    {
      response.setContentTypeIfNotSet(picture.type());
      renderBinary(picture.get());
    }
  }
  
  public static void uploadPicture(Long id, Blob picture)
  {
    User user = User.findById(id);
    user.profilePicture = picture;
    user.save();
    index();
  }
~~~

Again, import the blob in the top of this controller:

~~~java
import play.db.jpa.Blob;
~~~

Some of this code may start to become familiar. Each of the actions takes and ID - this is the id of the user whose picture we wish to upload/download.

In uploadPicture - we merely make sure the picture is saved in the database. In getPicture, we first see if there is in fact a picture for this user - if there is we 'render' it, otherwise we do nothing.

Next we must introduce two routes to match these actions:

~~~
POST    /profile/uploadpicture/{id}             Profile.uploadPicture
GET     /profile/getpicture/{id}                Profile.getPicture
~~~

These should be self-explanatory.

Finally, we need to make sure our view uses precisely these routes. This is the relevant section of views/Profile/index.html:

~~~html
      <div class="ui column">
        <p>
          <img src="images/homer.gif" />
        </p>
        <form action="homeprofile/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
          <input type="file" name="userfile" value="" /> <input type="submit" name="submit" value="upload" />
        </form>
      </div>
~~~

Completely replace the above with this version:

~~~html
      <div class="ui column">
        <p>
          <img src="/profile/getpicture/${user.id}">
        </p>
        <form action="/profile/uploadpicture/${user.id}" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">    
          <input type="file" name="picture" /> 
          <input type="submit" name="submit" value="upload" />
        </form>
      </div>
~~~

Note carefully the routes used, and also the input type 'file'.

Save everything and see if this works as expected.

Our final change will be to the user profile page - when we visit a users page we must display the image in the database for that user (not a hard coded reference to a file in the images directory). This is in UserProfile/visit.html. The images is now available via the route:

~~~html
      <img src="/profile/getpicture/${user.id}"/> 
~~~

This completes all of the features we will introduce this semester.
