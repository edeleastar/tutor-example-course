Web Design

Building a web site is not just a matter or using correct and pleasing CSS and HTML layout, it also involves project planing and management. This involves considering the general context of the site under development, gaining an overall perspective of the customers needs before work commences, and in general following a plan in order to complete quality work in a timely manner.
