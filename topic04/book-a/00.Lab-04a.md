#Objectives

Restructure the output of the last lab to participate in a tabbed navigation structure, and then produce a simple application mockup using these techniques. Do this by introducing a simple tabbed design into the site to provide the user with the visual metaphor for navigation. We then 'wire-up' these tabs to lead the user through the site. We will do this twice: once for the example content we laid out in last weeks lab. Then we will apply this to the app store site, using the same CSS rules.
