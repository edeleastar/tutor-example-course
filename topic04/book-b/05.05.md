#Revised Index Layout

The home pages can be enhanced somewhat - perhaps improving the use of images on the page and also incorporating a simple multi-column structure.

Here are the rules:

~~~
.banner {
  background: url("assets/images/banner.jpg") top center;
  background-position: top center;
  height:350px;
}

#summary
{
  width: 40%;
  float: left;
  color: white;
  background : rgba(58,84,90, 0.5);
  margin : 1em;
  padding : 1em;
  clear:both;
}

#curriculum
{
  width: 100%;
  margin: .5em;
  padding: .5em;
  clear: both;
}

#col1 {
  float: left;
  width: 48%
}

#col2 {
  float: right;
  width: 48%
}

#sponsors
{
  width: 100%;
  clear: both;
}

#footer
{
  width: 100%;
  clear: both;
}
~~~

Some of these rules are familiar from earlier layout labs.

To align `index.html` with these rules we need to make some adjustments to the structure of the page. In particular we need to wrap various sections in `<div>` elements, so that their properties can be targeted in interesting ways.

Here is the complete `<body>` element - which you can replace in `index.html`:

~~~
<div id="header">
  <h2>
    <img class="header-crest-img" src="assets/images/wit-crest.png" alt="WIT Crest">

</div>

<div class="banner">
  <div id="summary">

      BACHELOR OF SCIENCE (HONOURS)
    </p>

    <h3>

    </p>

<div id="curriculum">
  <hr>
  <div id="col1">
    <h2><a href="strands/programming.html"> Programming </a></h2>
    <p>
      Learn a broad range of programming and problem solving skills, including exciting new platforms, software tools and languages. Use these skills to build apps for mobile, cloud and device based IoT applications. Evolve a porfolio of facinating aplications.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="strands/data.html"> Data Science </a></h2>
    <p>
      At the heart of many IoT applications is data: measurements, events alarms and other information that must be relayed, stored and ultimately turned into knowledge. Learn the fundamentals of modern approaches to data in this strand.
    </p>
    <h2><a href="strands/devices.html"> Devices </a></h2>
    <p>
      The 'Things' we connect to are often physical devices. These can range from simple temperature sensors to sophisticated control systems like traffic lights or cameras. Connecting to and interacting with the physical world is the subject of this strand.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="col2">
    <h2><a href="strands/networks.html"> Networks </a></h2>
    <p>
      This strand will explore modern networks and cloud technology. Be able to configure, network and manage all categories of computer systems from simple controlers to single board board computers, mobiles and full workstations.

Notice we are using a background image for the `banner` section 

~~~
.banner {
  background: url("assets/images/banner.jpg") top center;
  background-position: top center;
  height:350px;
}
~~~

... and the summary section has an opacity of 0.5 set for its background:

~~~
#summary
{
  width: 40%;
  float: left;
  color: white;
  background : rgba(58,84,90, 0.5);
  margin : 1em;
  padding : 1em;
  clear:both;
}
~~~

This serves to enhance the readability of the panel. In Firefox Style Editor you can dynamically change this value and immediately observe the effect:

Otherwise the page is styled using simple percentage widths and floats.
