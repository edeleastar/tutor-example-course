#Open Sans

The default font is adequate - but perhaps not particularly elegant or readable. We can expect the browser to support a range of fonts - summarised here:

- <http://www.cssfontstack.com/>

Selecting any one of these fonts will take you to a page showing you the exact CSS you would need to include.

It is also possible to download fonts dynamically over the web - some of these are cataloged here:

- <http://www.cssfontstack.com/Web-Fonts>

This is a popular and pleasing one:

This one is used in WIT Moodle.

To use it, we much first make sure our `<head>` section includes this element:

~~~
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans" />
~~~

The above will need to be includes in all the pages of our site (including all the strand pages).

Then we can select the font for all our pages by adjusting our `body` rule in the style sheet:

~~~
body {
  max-width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  font-family: 'Open Sans';
}
~~~

Make these changes now to switch over completely to Open Sans.  Read about the background to the font here:
