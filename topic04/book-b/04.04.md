#Image Sizing

The images throughout the site are rendered without any size adjustments. Many are outsize and do not give an optimal user experience.

One simple strategy to address this diversity of image sizes could be to introduce a series of rules to establish a preferred height for each image. We have a number of image types - which we target in these rules:

~~~
.footer-img {
  height: 90px;
}

.strand-right-img {
  float: right;
  margin: 1em;
  height: 350px;
}

.strand-left-img {
  float: left;
  margin: 1em;
  height: 350px;
}

.strand-timeline-img {
  height: 80px;
}

.strand-modules-img {
  height: 75px;
}

.strand-modules-double-img {
  height: 150px;
}

.strand-modules-treble-img {
  height: 310px;
}
~~~

The first rule is targeting the images at the end of the index page:

~~~
<h4> Supported by leading edge research at... </h4>
<p>
  <img class="footer-img" src="assets/images/tssg.png" alt="TSSG">
  <img class="footer-img" src="assets/images/ctrg.png" alt="CTRG">
  <img class="footer-img" src="assets/images/automotive.png" alt="ATG">
</p>
~~~

Test this now - and these 'sponsor' images show appear more uniform.

The remaining rules are associated with each of the strand pages -`project.html` for instance:

~~~

<h1> Project </h1>
<p>
  <img class="strand-right-img" src="../assets/images/iot/project/project-1.png">
  The programme will promote an ethos of collaboration, practical application, and innovation. A project module will be included at each stage of the programme (apart from semester 1) that, through individual and collaborative projects, will challenge students to combine the knowledge and skills acquired in the various strands. Each project module will also elaborate on a theme, orthogonal to the programme disciplines, but central to the student’s individual development.
</p>

<p>
  <img class="strand-timeline-img" src="../assets/images/iot/timeline.png">
  <img class="strand-modules-double-img" src="../assets/images/iot/project/project-modules.png">
</p>

<h2> Project Learning Path </h2>
<p>
  <img class="strand-left-img" src="../assets/images/iot/project/project-2.jpeg">  The project will be assessed via a single report and presentation each semester. The report will demonstrate an artefact of the student’s choosing that integrates knowledge from two or more strands. This may be in the form of a software application, software/hardware combination, paper or combination of all of these. The ‘Orthogonal’ dimension must be addressed in the context of this report/presentation. The tuition team across each of the strands will stimulate project ideas and concepts for consideration by the students, who may take on board specific suggestions. Students as expected to proceed with ideas and concepts that particularly interest them individually, or collectively, in small teams.
</p>
~~~

Note carefully the classes associated with each of the images here - and make these changes to all of the strand pages.

The `strand-modules..` rules are for varying the height modules images, depending on whether there are 1, 2 or 3 rows of modules in the images.

Make all these adjustments now so that the images appear more or less uniformly.
