#Exercises

##Exercise 1

See if you can deploy your assignment 1 project using surge. Here are the steps:

- Make sure you have the node+harp+surge packages installed on your computer.
- Create a new (empty) folder to contain your project. Into this folder place a file called `harp.json', containing the following contents:

~~~
{
  "globals": 
  {

  }
}
~~~

- Place your entire project into a folder called `public` inside this project folder (as we did in step 06).
- From the command line, enter the command:

~~~
harp server
~~~

- Verify that your side it available on:

    - <http://localhost:9000/>


- Terminate the server with ^C, and then enter:

~~~
surge
~~~

- This will deploy the web site:

~~~
  project path: G:\dev\iot-web\
               size: 34 files, 2.3 MB
             domain: XXX.surge.sh
             upload: [====================] 100%, eta: 0.0s
   propagate on CDN: [====================] 100%
               plan: Free
              users: youremail@domain.com
         IP address: 192.241.214.148

    Success! Project is published and running at XXX.surge.sh
~~~

- Verify that the site is available on the domain. You will have the opportunity to change the domain `XXX`
- Exchange project URLs with your friends!
- You may have had relative paths in your html files:

~~~
  <a href="../stuff/mupage.html"> my stuff </a>
~~~

##Exercise 2:

Study the `iot-web-ejs` site carefully:

~~~

~~~

- or even more confusing:

~~~
  <a href="../../stuff/mupage.html"> my stuff </a>
~~~

These type of references can all be replaced with:

~~~
  <a href="/stuff/mypage.html"> my stuff </a>
~~~

~~~
  <a href="/stuff/mypage.html"> my stuff </a>
~~~

- Try this now - one link at a time to make sure it works.


##Exercise 2

Examine the project you created in step 6 again:

~~~
iot-web-ejs
├── harp.json
└── public
    ├── assets
    │   └── images
    │      ...
    ├── includes
    │   ├── _curriculum.ejs
    │   ├── _footer.ejs
    │   ├── _header.ejs
    │   ├── _sponsors.ejs
    │   └── _summary.ejs
    ├── index.ejs
    ├── strands
    │   ├── _layout.ejs
    │   ├── data.ejs
    │   ├── devices.ejs
    │   ├── maths.ejs
    │   ├── networks.ejs
    │   ├── programming.ejs
    │   └── project.ejs
    └── style.css
~~~


This is the same site we deployed earlier - but divided into templates using EJS:

- <http://www.embeddedjs.com>

This systems is documented better here:

- <http://harpjs.com/docs/development/ejs>

See if you can adapt your assignment 1 project to use EJS templates. This may reduce the amount of HTML you have in the project, and also allow you to have set of smaller files to maintain - but perhaps more of them.
