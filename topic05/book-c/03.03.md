#Serving the site with Harp.js

To date you have been opening the web pages you have designed by locating them on your PC and opening the browser directly. This is adequate for simple pages, but does not accurately reproduce how the page/site will be browsed when it is deployed on the public Internet.

To reproduce this experience, we will need to install a `web server` on our workstations, start this server and have it make our site available in a simulated network. Some server tools can also help simplify the work flow of deploying our site to a public server so that it is accessible globally. We will attempt both in this lab.

Download this archive here 

- [node.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2068306/node.zip)

Unzip the archive to the root of C: drive. This may take a few minutes. The archive is not large, but contains many small files...

Make double sure the folder is in the root of C: drive - open a Command Prompt (see last step) and set G: to be your default drive, and list all directories:

~~~
C:\Users\yourid> cd \
C:\> dir
...
Directory of C:\
...
...
11/02/2015   10:00 AM <DIR>    node  
...
C:\>
~~~

Then type the following command:

~~~
C:\> \node\init
~~~

It may respond with a scree full of information, which you can ignore.

Now type the following (first line only):

~~~
C:\> harp init demo
Downloading boilerplate: https://github.com/harp-boilerplates/default
Initialized project at c:\demo
~~~

Then enter (first line only again):

~~~
C:\> cd demo
C:\demo> harp server
------------

Now browse to this url here:

- <http://localhost:9000>

and you should see this page:
