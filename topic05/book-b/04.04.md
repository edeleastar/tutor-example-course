#Icons

We have already seen how to integrate icons into our site in step 2 (twitter, facebook and linkedin). 

We can also enhance other aspects of the site using icons - perhaps as a visual cue or aid, or also a a prompt for navigability:

There is a rich set of icons here:

- <http://semantic-ui.com/elements/icon.html>

We are going to use this one for navigation:
          
- <i class="huge sign in icon"></i>

and these ones for each of the strands:

- <i class="huge settings icon"></i>
- <i class="huge bar chart icon"></i>
- <i class="huge space shuttle icon"></i>
- <i class="huge cloud upload icon"></i>
- <i class="huge lab icon"></i>
- <i class="huge wizard icon"></i>

This is how they are included:

~~~
<i class="huge settings icon"></i>
<i class="huge bar chart icon"></i>
<i class="huge space shuttle icon"></i>
<i class="huge cloud upload icon"></i>
<i class="huge lab icon"></i>
<i class="huge wizard icon"></i>
~~~

In the home page curriculum section, experiment with the programming strand box:

~~~
...
    <article class="red column">
      <h2> Programming </h2>
      <p>
        Learn a broad range of programming and problem solving skills, including exciting new platforms, software tools and languages. Use these skills to build apps for mobile, cloud and device based IoT applications. Evolve a porfolio of facinating aplications.
      </p>
      <i class="huge settings icon"></i>
      <a href="strands/programming.html">
        <i class="huge sign in icon"></i>
      </a>
      </div>
    </article>
...
~~~

Try this now, the icons should appear on the programming strand + the 'sign in' icon should be a link to the programming strand page.

We might like to have the icons better spaced - in two columns perhaps. This can easily be done sing the grid mechanism we used for the header. Here is an alternative version:

~~~
...
  <article class="red column">
    <h2> Programming </h2>
    <p>
      Learn a broad range of programming and problem solving skills, including exciting new platforms, software tools and languages. Use these skills to build apps for mobile, cloud and device based IoT applications. Evolve a porfolio of facinating aplications.
    </p>
    <div class="ui two column grid">
      <div class="left aligned column">
        <i class="huge settings icon"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="right aligned column">
        <a href="strands/programming.html" class="strandlink">
          <i class="huge sign in icon"></i>
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </article>
...
~~~

Note how the icons are now embedded in a 2 column grid - and the individual icons are left and right aligned.

We can incorporate icons in a grid like this for all strands:

~~~
<section class="ui three column grid segment">
