#Banner

Currently the banner/summary section needs some attention:

![](img/20.png)

The text is not really legible - and is too wide to read. This is what we would like to have:

![](img/22.png)

Notice how the images is stretched to the edges.

The first step will be to rework the index.html page to have the image adjusted to the full width of the page:

~~~
<body>
  <section class="ui container">
    ...header
  </section>
  <section class="banner">
    <section class="ui container">
      <section class="ui grid">
        <article class="ui seven wide column raised blue segment">
          ... existing banner section... 
        </article>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section class="ui container">
    curriculum
    sponsors
    footer sections.
  </section>
</body>
~~~

In the above adjustments, we have excluded the `banner` section from the container class - which achieves the desired effect. Try it out now. Background image should stretch to the limit of the viewport, whereas the rest of the segments have appropriate margins left and right.

If you are having difficulty, here is the complete `<body>` element from the home page:
