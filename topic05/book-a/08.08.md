#Grids II

We can apply the same principles to tidy up the  sponsors section the home page:
~~~
<section class="ui segment">
  <h4> Supported by leading edge research at... </h4>
  <p>
    <img class="footer-img" src="assets/images/tssg.png" alt="TSSG">
    <img class="footer-img" src="assets/images/ctrg.png" alt="CTRG">
    <img class="footer-img" src="assets/images/automotive.png" alt="ATG">
  </p>
</section>
~~~

This currently looks like this:

And we would like to make it look like this:

To achieve this, we need to think of the section consisting of 2 rows. The first row is the single line of text:

~~~
  <h4> Supported by leading edge research at... </h4>
~~~

and the second row is the three images:

~~~
    <img class="footer-img" src="assets/images/tssg.png" alt="TSSG">
    <img class="footer-img" src="assets/images/ctrg.png" alt="CTRG">
    <img class="footer-img" src="assets/images/automotive.png" alt="ATG">
~~~

The Semantic-UI grid systems provides the tools for this:

- <http://semantic-ui.com/collections/grid.html>

Have a look at this version of this section:

~~~
<section class="ui grid segment">
  <section class="ui row">
    <p> Supported by leading edge research at... </p>
  </section>
  <section class="ui three column row">
    <div class="ui column">
      <img class="ui image" src="assets/images/tssg.png">
    </div>
    <div class="ui column">
      <img class="ui image" src="assets/images/ctrg.png">
    </div>
    <div class="ui column">
      <img class="ui image" src="assets/images/automotive.png">
    </div>
  </section>
</section>
~~~

It is a grid segment - with two rows. The first row has no columns - it is the full width of the section. The second row is a `three column` row. Try this out now:

One more change to center align the elements:

~~~
<section class="ui center aligned grid segment">
  <section class="ui row">
    <p> Supported by leading edge research at... </p>
  </section>
  <section class="ui three column row">
    <div class="ui column">
      <img class="ui image" src="assets/images/tssg.png">
    </div>
    <div class="ui column">
      <img class="ui image" src="assets/images/ctrg.png">
    </div>
    <div class="ui column">
      <img class="ui image" src="assets/images/automotive.png">
    </div>
  </section>
</section>
~~~
