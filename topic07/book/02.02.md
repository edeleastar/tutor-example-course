Run the app from the command line as before. I.e. in the Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project and enter:

~~~
play run
~        _            _ 
~  _ __ | | __ _ _  _| |
~ | '_ \| |/ _' | || |_|
~ |  __/|_|\____|\__ (_)
~ |_|            |__/   
~
~ play! 1.3.0, http://www.playframework.org
~
~ Ctrl+C to stop
~
