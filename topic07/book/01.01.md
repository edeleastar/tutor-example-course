#Lab06 Exercises

This lab assumes you have competed Lab06c. This is the project you may have imported last week (the final version):

- [spacebook-baseline.zip](archives/spacebook-baseline.zip)

To open this project in Eclipse, download and extract this archive somewhere suitable on your PC. Make sure you know where! Once extracted, navigate to that folder in a Command Prompt. Then, type:

~~~
play eclipsify
~~~

You should get a suitable message. Back in eclipse, select 'File-Import->General->Existing project into workspace' and select the `folder` containing the project you have just extracted. Select the project and it will become another project in your workspace called 'spacebook-baseline'. Note: you cannot have 2 projects of the same name in a workspace. So if you have already imported 'spacebook-baseline' last week, you will not be able to import this version.


##Lab 06: Exercise 1: Active Tab

If you look at the nav bar you will notice that there is no concept of an 'active' tab as such. i.e. user cannot clearly see which tab they have just selected.

The reason of this is that none of the `<li>` elements are have `class="ui active item"` (check the lab05-project to see what this looks like).

~~~
<nav class="ui menu">
  <a class="ui active item" href="/home">Home</a>
  <a class="ui item" href="/members">Members</a>
  <a class="ui item" href="/profile">Profile</a>
  <a class="ui item" href="/login">Logout</a>
</nav>
~~~

##Lab 06: Exercise 1 Solution

Currently, each page has an identical navigation bar - with none of the nav items marked active. We would to rework the navigation to fix this - i.e. have each navigation bar customised to each view.

##views/Home/index.html
~~~
<nav class="ui menu"> 
  <a class="ui active item" href="/home">Home</a>      
  <a class="ui item" href="/members">Members</a>   
  <a class="ui item" href="/profile">Profile</a>   
  <a class="ui item" href="/login">Logout</a>      
</nav>
~~~

##views/Members/index.html
~~~
<nav class="ui menu"> 
  <a class="ui item" href="/home">Home</a>      
  <a class="ui active item" href="/members">Members</a>   
  <a class="ui item" href="/profile">Profile</a>   
  <a class="ui item" href="/login">Logout</a>      
</nav>
~~~

##views/Profile/index.html
~~~
<nav class="ui menu"> 
  <a class="ui item" href="/home">Home</a>      
  <a class="ui item" href="/members">Members</a>   
  <a class="ui active item" href="/profile">Profile</a>   
  <a class="ui item" href="/login">Logout</a>      
</nav>
