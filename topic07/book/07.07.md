#User Profile III

How about displaying some content for marges and lisa's profile pages. 

Open 'visit.html' - incorporate this content replacing the `<p>` element 

~~~html
<section class="ui raised segment">
  <div class="ui small header"> ${name}'s Profile</div>
  <section class="ui  two column grid segment">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <div class="ui medium image">
          <img src=""> 
        </div>  
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h2> Messages </h2> 
        <ul> 
          <li>homer says..."What time is dinner?"</li>      
          <li>lisa says..."Where is my saxaphone?"</li>      
          <li>homer says..."Where are you?"</li>      
        </ul> 
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>    
</section>
~~~

Save and refresh the profile page for lisa and marge. Verify that the user name and list of messages appears. However, no images appear yet. Download and save these two images:

- [lisa.gif](img/lisa.gif)
- [marge.gif](img/marge.gif)

and save them in the `public/images` folder of your project. Now replace the `<img>` element in the page with the following:

~~~html
    <img src="/public/images/${name}.gif"/> 
~~~

Verify now that we are getting the correct image when we visit these pages. The messages, however, don't change.

One last piece of tidying up to do. Our Routes file currently begins with this line:

~~~
# Landing page
GET     /                                       Application.index
~~~

Change this to the following:

~~~
# Landing page
GET     /                                       Home.index
~~~

Do you see the significance of this? Try some experiments with/without this change to see if you can understand the effect.

You can now delete Application.java and the Application view from the project
