#Public Profile II

How do we communicate from our java method:

~~~java
  public static void visit(String name)
  {
    Logger.info("Just visiting the page for " + name);
    render();
  }
~~~

To our 'views/PublicProfile/visit.html' view?

~~~html
#{extends 'main.html' /}
#{set title:'Spacebook' /}

<nav class="ui menu">   
  <a class="ui active item" href="/home">Back to Home</a> 
</nav>

<p>
  Welcome to the Public Profile!
</p>
~~~

Specifically, the name of the member we are visiting? 

Try this. We can pass this as a parameter to render:

~~~java
  public static void visit(String name)
  {
    Logger.info("Just visiting the page for " + name);
    render(name);
  }
~~~

The above fragment is a new version of the visit method in the UserProfile controller class. Look carefully at how we have changed the call to render() - and make this change in your own version.

In 'views/UserProfile/visit.html', we can pick it up in the header, or work it into the body:

~~~html
#{extends 'main.html' /}
#{set title:'Spacebook' /}

<nav class="ui menu">   
  <a class="ui active item" href="/home">Back to Home</a> 
</nav>

<p>
  This is the profile page for ${name}
</p>
~~~

Make the above change to visit.html and visit Lisa and Marges pages and verify that the correct names are being displayed. 

Note carefully the use of `${name}` - this is substituted, when the page is assembled, by whatever value is passed to render.
